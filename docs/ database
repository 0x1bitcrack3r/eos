# group `database` 

APIs that store and retreive data on the blockchain

EOS.IO organizes data according to the following broad structure:

* **code** - the account name which has write permission

* **scope** - an account where the data is stored

* **table** - a name for the table that is being stored

* **record** - a row in the table

Every transaction specifies the set of valid scopes that may be read and/or written to. The code that is running determines what can be written to; therefore, write operations do not allow you to specify/configure the code.

Attempts to read and/or write outside the valid scope and/or code sections will cause your transaction to fail.

table TypesThese are the supported table types identified by the number and size of the index:

* dbi64

The databaseCpp provides a simple interface for storing any fixed-size struct as a database row.
